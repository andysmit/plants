## Project Outline

### Problem approach: 
Before I started any code, I started breaking the project into smaller tasks. Backend would consist of smaller tasks such as database creation, api creation, etc. From there, I followed the requirements of the proposal and created the full stack application. I started with the backend first because it will be used by the frontend. I used Postman to test out the api functions to increase time for development. After the backend is completed, the frontend is next to use the backend api. I focused on the functionality of the frontend before the visuals in order to see what data I have. After the frontend is completed, I deployed the full stack application to AWS and fixed any problems that I encountered. 

### Time spent (Development time)
Ranges from 6 to 8 hours
